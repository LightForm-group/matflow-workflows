description: >
  This workflow performs virtual materials testing using FFT crystal plasticity (with
  DAMASK). Experimental texture data is fed in to the workflow to produce an estimated
  orientation distribution function (ODF), which is then sampled to generate a set of 
  representative orientations (with MATLAB/MTEX). These orienations are then used to
  generate a representative volume element for use in the DAMASK simulations.
  
  To fit the yield functions, there are two simulation tasks: the first simulates uniaxial
  tension, and the second simulates a large set of random 3D load cases to sample
  different regions of principal yield stress space. The uniaxial simulation is used to
  calculate an "equivalent stress", which is a parameter included in most anisotropic
  yield functions within the literature. There are two "generate_load_case" tasks, and
  two corresponding "simulate_volume_element_loading" tasks. The first pair correspond to
  the uniaxial simulation, and the second to the random 3D load set simulations.

  The yield functions are fitted for three distinct rotation angles defined relative to
  the rolling direction. For each rotation angle, the yield functions are fitted for two
  distinct yield points.
